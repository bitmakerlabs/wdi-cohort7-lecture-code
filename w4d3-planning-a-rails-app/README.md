# Analyzing and planning a new Rails app
-------------------------------------------

Today we will be looking at how to go about planning and thinking through a Rails application. We will be talking about some of the things that need to be done before you start coding.

## Agenda

1. A quick digression about partial templates
2. User Stories
3. Planning
4. Modelling


## User Stories

As a ...
I want ...
So that...

- Who's the user?
- What do they need to do?
- Why do they need it? What is the goal they're trying to accomplish?

### EXAMPLES
- As a customer, I want to search for restaurants
- As a customer, I want to search for reviews
- As a customer, I want to know what's nearby
- As a customer, I want to filter by cuisine
- As a customer, I want to see the menu
- As a customer, I want to be able to make an account
- As a customer, I want to be able to make a reservation
- As an owner, I want to receive reservations
- As an owner, I want to know how many reservations I have
- As an owner, I want to know what people are searching for
- ...


## Prioritize
1. NEED TO HAVE
2. NICE TO HAVE
3. HAPPY TO HAVE


## Planning
- Make assumptions
    - Max Occupancy
    - All reservations have the same duration (1h)
- Simplify!

- Make mockups
    - Gather feedback
    - Usability
      - Maybe idea of user flow through the app
      - Visualize what the app will look like
      - Test prioritization (are important things important?)
      - Reveals missed user stories or flaws in assumptions


## Modelling
- Pen and paper / Whiteboard
    - Quick and easily changed
- Create models
- Draw relationships
- Repeat!
